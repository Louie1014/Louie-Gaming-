      <h2>My Top 3 Favorite Games</h2>
      <p>My top 3 favorite games are Minecraft, Roblox, and Valorant. 
      Minecraft is fun because I can build anything I imagine. Roblox lets me play so many games with my friends. 
      Valorant is exciting because of the teamwork and strategy.</p>

      <h2>Why I Love Roblox</h2>
      <p>Roblox is one of my favorite games because it feels like thereâ€™s always something new to try. 
      I enjoy creating my own character and exploring games made by other players. 
      The best part is playing with my classmates after school!</p>

      <h2>How I Balance Gaming and School</h2>
      <p>I balance gaming and school by finishing my homework first before I play. 
      Sometimes I use games as a reward for studying hard. 
      This way, I can enjoy my games without worrying about my grades.</p>
